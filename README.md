# flutter_application_1
This Flutter Project was made as a learning resource in the Peer Learning Workshop on Flutter. 
This project has 4 checkpoint (all different repos), each consisting stage by stage developmenmt of a simple login page and a home page.
I have already merged the last branch with the master branch.
If anyone wishes to see earlier phase of the app, they can look at the respective branches.
In future I will be completing this application as a simple e-commerce site using fakestore api and will integrate a proper authentication for login/signup.
